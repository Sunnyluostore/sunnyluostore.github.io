# How to Choose the Right Garment Buttons for Your Apparel

Garment buttons are more than just fasteners—they’re a key part of your apparel’s design and functionality. Here’s our expert guide to choosing the right buttons for your products:

## 1. Consider the Material
- **Metal Buttons**: Ideal for jeans, jackets, and heavy-duty apparel (durable, rust-resistant).
- **Plastic Buttons**: Lightweight, affordable, perfect for casual wear and children’s clothing.
- **Wooden Buttons**: Eco-friendly option for bohemian or natural-style apparel.

## 2. Match the Size to the Garment
- 10mm-15mm: Shirts, blouses
- 20mm-25mm: Jackets, sweaters
- 30mm+: Coats, bags

## 3. Customization Options
Our factory offers custom logo engraving on metal buttons, and custom colors on plastic buttons. Minimum order quantity (MOQ) starts at 1000 pcs.
